# Pokemon Chat App AI 

For this assignment we included OpenAI's GPT-4o-Mini integration with the function of summarizing the chatlogs

### Usage:
After opening a chatroom that has at least one message sent, click the summarize button. The summary of all conversations that have occurred in the chatroom will appear in the chat window.

### AI Model:
We chose to use GPT-4o-Mini as it has an easy to use and well documented API that is simple to integrate into our webapp. It does require a miniscule amount of funding however, the quality and speed of the requests far outpace those of the free models. Alternatives such as LLAMA and Google AI were considered but we found that there were less resources available for their API usage.

## Setup:
Dependencies:
* OpenAI
* node
* crypto
* express
* ws
