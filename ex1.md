Alex: Okay, we need to figure out this movie night. First, what are we watching? Any ideas?

Jamie: I'm leaning toward something funny. We could use a comedy after this week.

Taylor: True, but I was thinking action. Something with big explosions and, you know, cool fight scenes.

Alex: Hmm, comedy versus action. What about a compromise? Like an action-comedy?

Jamie: Oh, that works! What about The Nice Guys? It’s hilarious and has action too.

Taylor: That’s a solid choice. Or we could do something new, like Free Guy. Heard it’s pretty fun.

Alex: Ooh, Free Guy sounds great. It’s on streaming, right?

Jamie: Yeah, Disney+. Let’s go with that.

Taylor: Cool, so Free Guy it is. Next question: when are we doing this?

Alex: Tonight?

Jamie: I’m good with tonight if we start after 7.

Taylor: Same. How about 8 p.m.?

Alex: 8 works for me. Last thing—where are we watching?

Jamie: My place is fine. I just cleaned up the living room, and I have a decent sound system.

Taylor: Perfect. Should we bring snacks?

Alex: Definitely. I’ll grab popcorn and soda.

Jamie: I’ve got chips and dip covered.

Taylor: I’ll bring some candy. It’s not a movie night without candy!

Jamie: Can’t wait!

Taylor: See you both later!
